Incase of div and section the content moves to the new line where as for the span content remains in same line

 CSS Layout
 4 types of CSS layouts are
 Block
 Inline
 Inline - Block
 None

 *Block has different properties
 Dimension - changing height and width of the element accordingly it will adjust
 Auto Break - There is a line break at starting and ending by default for anything which is type block

*Inline
Inline doesn't have dimension and auto break. It gets adjusted automatically to the size of the content.

*Inline - Block
Inline has dimension but no auto break

*None 
It hides the particular content and it frees up the space occupied by that content

*Visibility
It hides the particular content and it doesn't free up the space occupied by that content

All the div tags by default takes display-block

All the span tags by default takes display-inline

Box -sizing can be of two types 

border-box and content-box

*border-box restricts the content according to the height and width dimensions 
the total width including box size, padding,margin doesnot exceed width and height

*Positioning in CSS
static
relative
absolute
fixed
sticky

Difference between relative and absolute - relative maintains original place whereas absolute
frees of original place

*If we want to scroll the page assign height and width to the div container

*absolute always works with parent position relative
If none of them have then it will consider the window as starting point for top and left dimensions

*For position Fixed - starting point is always the window nomattr whatever is its parent

* Sticky still a certain point it will scroll and furthur it doesn't move forward
Position scroll on change - it changes for up to some level and later on doesn't change

*overflow:
visible: even if content exceeds the size it is visible

hidden: if content exceeds the size it is not visible

scroll: scroll bar is visible even if content exceeds the size or no exceeds the size

auto: scroll bar is visible only if content exceeds the size
