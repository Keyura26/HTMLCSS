* Div has dimensions and it pushes the content to the next line whereas span doesn't have any dimension 
and doesn't push content to the new line

* Span is to put the content div is to provide the structure

* Div is block type it has dimensions and any other property will come down of it i.e next line

* When we say display flex all the content of a particular container is bydefault going to come
in the main axis i.e Default main axis is X-axis

*flex-direction:row is the default property

*100vh vh is the vertical height of the view i.e viewport height

*flex-direction:row -> Main axis is X-axis  Cross axis is Y-axis

*Justify content is used to align content according to main axis
*Align items is used to align content according to cross axis

*flex-direction:column -> Main axis is Y-axis  Cross axis is X-axis

* Give justifycontent as center and align items as center if we want to place items in the center of the page

*Gap is to give fixed space between the content

*flex-wrap is the property which wraps the content according to size of the element.It doesn't compress the size
of the element

flex-wrap : wrap wraps the content
flex-wrap : no wrap doesn't wrap content
wrap-reverse property fits the elements in the reverse direction instead of top to bottom it is bottom to top

For flex direction : row-reverse and column-reverse  property is also present.

*Media Query syntax in CSS - For different resolutions, different devices iift adds and modifies conditions for different 
conditions , different features and for different resolutions.

*Flex Grow helps to accomodate the particular element to the rest of the space available and make it responsive in nature
to the size by accomodating the content according to the page size

*Flex grow helps in making things responsive too

* *When we move beyond certain point to hide some features  or to align them vertically these kind of conditions we need to add
These are fulfilled by using media query.Media query is ntg but writing if condition in the CSS.

* @media MEDIA_TYPE(MEDIA_FEATURE OPERATOR MEDIA_FEATURE)

@media screen (min-width:320px and max-width:768px){
    .left-panel{
        //
    }
    .right-panel{
        //
    }
}

*We can play with different conditions within media query

*For media print it will apply the conditions that we have specified when we try to print the page

*For media query it works like if this condition meets then overwrite existing condition with this condition
