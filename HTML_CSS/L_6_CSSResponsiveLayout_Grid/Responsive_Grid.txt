* Outer layer of the Grid where we apply properties on is called as Container
*individual items in grid are known as Grid Items

* With auto property in grid template column it adjusts the size according to the 
size of the content in it , fr adjusts the content in multiple line in single rows

*If we want to get equal height and contain entire stuff of the screen with grid property

*By default browser(browser agent) gives margin for the body of content and we can set it to zero

* vh - view port height - it is visible as per given dimensions -100vh means 100% 
whereas vw is viewport width

*In flex we can control only 1 dimensional whereas in grid it is 2 dimensional

*Justify-items is used to align items in the center when given center as property

*justify-items and align-items are used to  manage the items inside the grid

*At container level  we use align item property and at item levelwe use align self property

*grid-auto-row - talks about in which direction we need to fill first
and what is the default configuration we need to give

if we need to place things one after another in vertical direction in row fashion

* If there is no particular configuration for any row we take
grid-auto-row as configuration for that particular row

*auto-fill property specifies that particular property takes care of
how many columns we require instead of specifying a static number
based on column size
